FETCHING DATA AND TYPE SAFETY: FETCHIND DATA FROM SANITY

For you to be able to fetch data from studio you have to use querylanguage (groq); groq is a sanity open source query language. With groq you can describe exactly what information your application needs. 

how it works.
navigate to your studio localhost3000/studio and open the vision tab, you will see query and params. * query means get everything.
*[]= this will fetch the first property.
*[_type== 'startup'] this will fetch all startup

to be more specific about bthe particular data to fetch we can run a query like this:
 *[_type == 'startup' && defined(slug.current)]{
  _id, title, slug, _createdAt, author, views, description, category,image
} now we are requesting for 9 properties.

Now how can we get additional information about the author of the post? you fetch it like this:
*[_type == 'startup' && defined(slug.current)]{
  _id, title, slug, _createdAt,
    author ->{
      _id, name, slug, image, bio
    },
    views, description, category,image
}

we wont be making call from sanity studio vision rather we will do that in sanity folder, lib folder there we create a new file queries.ts, this is where  we will write our queries which we will use to fetch the data.

after writing our query how can we now fetch it? we go to homepage page.tsx

we are yet to have startupTypeCard, for sanity tohave access to all type of typescript we will run an additional package npx sanity@latest schema extract --path=./sanity/extract.json
next we create a new file in the root of our application called sanity-typegen.json, configure it. 
then run npx sanity schema extract, this will create a schema.json file in the root of our application. 
Then run npx sanity@latest typegen generate typescript types for schemas.

Then we go to package.json to add a few new script.
run npm run typegen to generate typescript types for schemas.
