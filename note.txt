CREATING SANITY SCHEMA
for our structure we need to store startup submitted by a user which contains title , slug(unique name), author( the author will be authenticated through github, which ,means we will get every infor from github), views, description, category, image and pitch. We then need to group those startup in a kind of playist. 
We first create a schema for the author.
we created a new schema type called author.ts. 
so you define the author. this is where we will create our author. after that we will we will use it in index.ts in the array and importing it. 
then we structure it in structure.ts file where we will list the things that sanity provide.

we created startup schema too and pass it to index and structure files. in startup.ts file we made use of a markdown type in the last object of the array, that means we will need to install a markdown parkage by running  npm install sanity-plugin-markdown
after installing go to sanity.config file add it at the plugins as a function make sure u import it from sanity-plugin-markdown.

then we go to layout.tsx in app folder to add all the general configuration. what we did was to import a styling css from this link import 'easymde/dist/easymde.min.css'; this will make sure our editor looks great.

run  npm install easymde to install easymde so that the styles so that the styles can works properly.

Now go to localhost3000/studio. You can create an author directly  from your studio.

we have been able to create an author and a startup in our studio and now how can we show it in our website.?
