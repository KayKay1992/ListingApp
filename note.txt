HERO SECTION, SETTING GLOBAL STYLES BY CREATING UTILITY CLASS AND INSTALLING SHADCN

We can create a utility class for heading in hero session because we will need to reuse it in many pages. we did this in globals.css file  using @layer utilities. So we set up our globals.css and add some other utility classes. 

Integrating shadcn in our app.
shadcn is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable react components that you can use tto build modern web applications with Nextjs. with shadcn you can quickly and easily create user interfaces that are both stylish and functional.
go to the shadcn site and for cli. the init command is used to initalise configuration and dependencies for a new project. the init command installs dependencies so run the init command which is npx shadcn@latest init in your terminal.
you need a strong network or it will give econnreset error. 
After installing shadcn your tailwind.config and globals.css will be altered so go back to those files and reset it as it was.

Then go to page.tsx homepage and continue setting your heropage using the classname from your globals.css file.
