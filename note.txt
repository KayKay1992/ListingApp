SANITY WRITE CLIENT: using it to understand how to use ppr

we have to sanity write client to allow users perfom write activities. for this we need to generate a token with write permission through the sanity manage website .

first go to sanity.io/manage for navigate to the particular project, click on api, click on token, click on add token, give your token a name like create and update startup, then select read and write access to all datasets for editors not viewers and save. 

copy the token and set it in your .env.local file. 
now go to env.ts in sanity folder and also export const token make it equal to process.env.SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN

Then go to lib in sanity folder and create a new file write-client.ts file, we export write-client.ts and configured with the token and we also import server only because it is going to run only on server.

UPDATE THE NUMBER OF views
then we go to view component and await the writeClient patching the id as update, setting the current number of views and commiting it.

unstable after functionality: this allows you to schedule work to be executed after a response is finished. we use this functionality to update the views in the  background without blocking the ui. in view componnet we will import unstable_after as asfter from 'next/server'. then wrap the after writeClient into server and set it into its own async
