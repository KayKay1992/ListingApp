Theming and Fonts
Every website has a unique theme and font. to ensure this we have to set up our tailwind config. we set up our styless including theme, font, colors etc.
we then install a package that will be used to animate our project with this command npm i tailwindcss-animate, along tailwindcss-animate we still have tailwindcss typography which helps us to further play with fonts. to install tailwind typography run the following command npm install @tailwindcss/typography. then reload your project.
then we set our primary layout of our application to allow for tailwindcss theming, also set up our local fonts to make you not to depend on external services like google fonts
