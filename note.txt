Startup details page proper.

we started by creating a section at page.tsx for product details at dynamic id.
after creating our startup details in creating our pitch we installed markdown with this command npm install markdown-it it converts your pitch to html format to render it in ui.
once it get installed we get parsed markeddown content.

markdown might be complaining use this command to force the correct type  npm i --save-dev @types/markdown-it

we import markdown and initialise it then we set it as html

Now to render ppr content .i.e a dynamic content that changes we will use suspense from react to render d skeleton which we will import from shadcn  we will install the package with npx shadcn@latest add skeleton

for the dynamic ping to indicate the number of views we  created a component view .tsx which we used inside the details page.tsx then we created another componenet for the dynamic ping which is ping.tsx which we used inside view.tsx. 

to get the current number of views we have to get a separate query from sanity for it. we then write the query in queries.ts
