All startups and Startup card.

We created a startup card with a dummy data, 
we made the date dynamic by craeting the formDate function in utils.ts file and passing it to the statup card component.

Because we will be using a placeholder in our image Nextjs will be throwing and error because the site is not authorised so we will go to next.config.ts to set up our image config.

Inthe Button we used asChild prop because we want to use a link inside the button.

We have been able to create our startupCard ui but with dummy data the next thing is to be able to add a startup card. we will do this using sanity first we will set it up.
