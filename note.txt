SEARCH FORM:

We created a new component in component fffolder which we called searchForm.tsx, where we created a functional component for search form and exported while we imported it in our homepage inside the hero section.

the search form which is a server side rendering has a button interactivity which is client side rendering so we created separate component for the form reset button. we converted this component to client side by alling the use client op top the component.

To turn our normal button to shadcn button we ran this command npx shadcn@latest add button. when we installed this component it created a separate component folder outside the outside the app folder which is the right thing. so we moved every component file in our old component folder to the new one created. and got rid of the old component folder. then we updated the path.
